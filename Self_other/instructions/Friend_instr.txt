Welcome to our experiment.

In the experiment, you will respond to a number of trials. You will need to wear headphones. 

Each trial will start with a fixation cross, followed by a prompt. The prompt will prompt you to decide whether the upcoming word describes your friend (think about one partiulcar friend) or is in uppercase.

You are required to respond with {ans_0}/{ans_1} according to the prompt:  If the prompt is Friend; press Yes if the upcoming word describes your friend or No if it does not. If the prompt is Uppercase; press Yes if the upcoming word is in uppercase or No if it is not uppercase.

If the answer is:
	- {ans_0} - press {key_0}
	- {ans_1} - press {key_1}


You should try to be as quick and accurate as possible.
