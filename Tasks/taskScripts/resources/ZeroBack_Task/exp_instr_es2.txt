When this happens you will be asked to decide which of the shapes is the same as the one in the centre. 
If the shape on the left matches the one in the centre, press the key “1”.
If the shape on the right matches the one in the centre, press the key “2”. 
You only need to make a response on the trials whether shapes are presented in red.
